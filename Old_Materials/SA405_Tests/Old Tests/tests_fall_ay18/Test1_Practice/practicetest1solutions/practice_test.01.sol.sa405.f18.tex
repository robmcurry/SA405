\question
US NorthWest plans to install fiber in a metro area network that is expected to experience increased demand due to the opening of a large manufacturing facility.  The Central Offices (COs) in the network are represented by vertices in the graph below.  The edges in the graph represent the possible fiber paths linking the COs.  The number on edge $(i,j)$ represents the cost $c_{ij}$ (in \$1000) of installing fiber between COs $i$ and $j$.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width = .4\textwidth]{uswest_network}
\end{center}

Network planners developed the following partial integer program to solve for the collection of edges that will minimize the cost of connecting all the central offices in the network via a fiber spanning tree.  (Let $V$ represent the set of vertices in the graph.  Let $E$ represent the set of edges in the graph.)

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mst}
  \tag{MST}
  \begin{array}{llll}
    \min & \displaystyle \sum_{(i,j)\in E} c_{ij} X_{ij} & & \\
    \mbox{s.t.} & \sum_{j:(i,j) \in E} X_{ij} + 
    \sum_{j:(j,i) \in E} X_{ji} \geq 1, & \forall i \in V &
    \mbox{(a)} \\[4mm]
    & \sum_{(i,j) \in E} X_{ij} = ~? & & \mbox{(b)} \\[4mm]
    &  t \sum_{\substack{i,j \in V' \\ (i,j) \in E}} X_{ij} \leq |V'| - 1 & \forall V' \subseteq V & \mbox{(c)} \\[4mm]
    & X_{ij} \in \{0,1\} & \forall (i,j) \in E. &
  \end{array}
\end{equation}



\begin{parts}
  

\part Write the concrete form of constraint type (a) from \eqref{eq:mst} for vertex 4. What is the purpose of this constraint?

%\[  \sum_{j:(4,j) \in E} X_{4j} +  \sum_{j:(j,4) \in E} X_{j4} \ge 1 \]
%or
%\[ X_{45} + X_{47} + X_{24} + X_{23} \ge 1 \]
%
%This constraint ensures that vertex 4 is connected to at least one other node.
%\vfill

%\part What GUSEK code would implement the objective function? Assume that $c$, $X$ and $E$ have already been defined for you.  
%
%\begin{verbatim}
%minimize obj:sum{(i,j) in E} c[i,j] * X[i,j];
%\end{verbatim}
%\vfill

%\newpage

\part Architect Ima Klutz spilled cappuccino on the formulation rendering the right hand side of constraint (b) illegible.  What is the purpose of constraint (b), and what should the missing number be?

%\[  \sum_{(i,j) \in E} X_{ij} = n-1 = 6 \]
%
%The purpose of this constraint is to ensure we have $n-1$ edges in our tree that contains $n$ nodes.
%\vfill

\part The modeling team learns that city ordinances require that if link $(3,7)$ is built, then neither $(1,2)$ nor $(3,4)$ may be built.  Write a constraint to model this new requirement.

%\[ 2 - 2 X_{37} \ge X_{12} + X_{34} \]
%
%
%We can derive this constraint from the rule that says that when we want to model the constraint ``(binary variable) $Y = 1$ implies $f \leq 0$'' we use  $f \leq M(1-Y)$ where $M$ is a constant chosen so that $f \leq M$ always holds. Here the variable $X_{37}$ plays the role of $Y$ and requiring that $X_{12} = 0$ and $X_{34}=0$ is the same as requiring that $X_{12}+X_{34} \leq 0$, so $X_{12}+X_{34}$ plays the role of $f$. The quantity $f$ is clearly always less than 2 so we can take $M = 2$. This gives the answer above. 
%
%\vfill

\part The Central Office represented by vertex 3 is centrally located, but the equipment there is outdated.  If vertex 3 is used as a hub, meaning three or more fiber paths meet at vertex 3, the Central Office there will require a \$25,000 upgrade.  The modeling team adds a new binary variable $Y$ that indicates whether or not vertex 3 is used as a hub in the network design.  They modify the objective function by adding the term $25*Y$.  Write a constraint that forces $Y$ to be 1 if three or more selected edges connect to vertex 3.

%\[ X_{13} + X_{23} + X_{34} + X_{36} + X_{37} \le 3 Y + 2 \]
%
%We obtain this solution as follows. First we see that we want to impose the condition ``$X_{13} + X_{23} + X_{34} + X_{36} + X_{37} \geq 3$ implies $Y=1$''. This is logically equivalent to the condition that $Y = 0$ implies that $X_{13} + X_{23} + X_{34} + X_{36} + X_{37} \leq 2$. We'd like to use the rule mentioned in part (d) but our assumption is that $Y=0$, not $Y=1$. To fix this we introduce the variable $Z = 1-Y$. Now $Y=0$ precisely when $Z=1$, so we are trying to model ``$Z=1$ implies $X_{13} + X_{23} + X_{34} + X_{36} + X_{37} -2 \leq 0$''. This can be done using the rule with $f = X_{13} + X_{23} + X_{34} + X_{36} + X_{37} -2$ and $M = 3.$ We get 
%\[ X_{13} + X_{23} + X_{34} + X_{36} + X_{37} -2 \leq 3(1-Z), \]
%and substituting $Z = 1-Y$ we get 
%\[ X_{13} + X_{23} + X_{34} + X_{36} + X_{37} -2 \leq 3Y, \]
%which is equivalent to the condition that we gave as the answer above.
