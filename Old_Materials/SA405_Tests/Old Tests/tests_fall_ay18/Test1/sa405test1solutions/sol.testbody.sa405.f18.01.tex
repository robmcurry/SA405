Consider the following {\bf MINIMIZING}, canonical form linear program, labeled (P):
\vspace{-2mm}

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  \tag{P}
  \begin{array}{lll}
    \min & 3 x_1 \phantom{+  x_2} -  x_3 \phantom{+ 5 x_4} \\
    \mbox{s.t.} & x_1 + x_2 + x_3  + x_4 & = 4 \\[1mm]
    & -2 x_1 + x_2 - x_3  & = 1 \\
    & \phantom{-5 x_1} 3 x_2 + x_3 + x_4 &  = 9 \\
    & x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 \geq 0 &
  \end{array}
\end{equation}



\begin{parts}
\pts{3} Because (P) is in canonical form, it is in the form minimize $\mathbf{c}^T \mathbf{x} $ such that $A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}$.  Find the matrix $A$ and the vectors $\mathbf{b}$, and $\mathbf{c}$. 

$ \red{A = \left[ \begin{matrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ -2 & 1 & -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 & 1 & 1 \end{matrix} \right]}$\red{,} $\red{\mathbf{b}=\left[ \begin{matrix} 4 \\ 1 \\ 9 \end{matrix} \right]}$\red{,} $\red{\mathbf{c}^T=\left[ \begin{matrix} 3 \\ 0 \\ -1 \\ 0 \end{matrix} \right]}$.

\pts{2} A Basic Feasible Solution to (P) will have \underline{ \ \ \ \red{3} \ \ \ } basic variables and \underline{ \ \ \ \red{1} \ \ \ } nonbasic variables.

\pts{4} Given the feasible direction $d^{x_3} = [-2/3, -1/3, 1, 0]^T$, determine whether or not it is an improving direction.  Based on your answer about whether the direction is improving, state whether the simplex algorithm would continue or terminate at this point.  {\bf Briefly} explain your answer for full credit.  You may find it helpful to recall that $\bar c_k = c^T d^k = c_k + \sum_{i \in \mathcal{B}} c_i d_i^k$.

\vspace{0.5cm}
\red{We calculate the reduced cost for the nonbasic variable $x_3$ as follows: $\bar c_{x_3} = [3, 0, -1, 0]   \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{-2}{3} \\ \frac{-1}{3} \\ 1 \\ 0
  \end{bmatrix} = -2 - 1 = -3$.  Because we have a minimization problem and the reduced cost is negative, this is an improving simplex direction.  This means our current solution is not optimal, and the simplex algorithm will continue.}

\vfill
\newpage

\pts{3} If the initial solution is $x^0 = [1,3,0,0]^T$, and the simplex direction is $d^{x_3} = [-2/3, -1/3, 1, 0]^T$, use the ratio test to find the maximum step size, $\lambda$.  Based on your answer about $\lambda$, which variable will leave the basis and become nonbasic? You may find it helpful to recall that 

\[
\lambda_{max} = \min \left\{ \frac{x_j}{-d_j^k}:d_j^k < 0 \right\}
\]

\vspace{0.5cm}
\red{The improving simplex direction has two negative components, so we apply the rule given above to find $\lambda_{max} = \min \left\{ \frac{1}{\frac{2}{3}}, \frac{3}{\frac{1}{3}}\right\}= \min \left\{ \frac{3}{2}, 9 \right\} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5$.  Because $x_1$ defines the maximum step size, it will leave the basis and become nonbasic.}

\vfill

\pts{3} If the initial solution is $x^0 = [1,3,0,0]^T$, use your answer from part d above to compute the new solution generated by this iteration of the Simplex Method.  If you were not able to answer part d, use $\lambda_{max} = 3$.


\[
\red{x^1 = x^0 + \lambda_{max} d = [1,3,0,0]^T + \frac{3}{2} \left[\frac{-2}{3},\frac{-1}{3},1,0 \right]^T = [0,2.5,1.5,0]^T}
\]

\red{If you did not successfully answer parts a and c, you should have}

\[
\red{x^1 = x^0 + \lambda_{max} d = [1,3,0,0]^T + 3\left[\frac{-2}{3},\frac{-1}{3},1,0 \right]^T = [-1,2,3,0]^T}

%%formulation given to answer about
\ques{25} The directed network shown below illustrates the supply chain for a small beverage company, NEHI. Node 1 represents a factory, nodes 2 and 3 are warehouses, and node 4 is a retail store. NEHI can ship crates of RC cola along any arc. The number $c_{ij}$ on the arc $(i,j)$ represents the cost per crate to ship from node $i$ to node $j$. Below, we show the start of a model whose purpose is to minimize shipping costs while meeting demand constraints.

\pts{3} The brothers that run NEHI have just learned of a new, unusual, shipping requirement. If they send more than 20 cases from the factory to the warehouse at node 2 then they must also send at least 30 cases from the factory to the warehouse at node 3. Introduce constraints that impose this condition. Be sure to define any items you use in your constraints that are not already given above.

\vspace{0.25cm}

\red{We first add a binary decision variable $Z$ to the formulation, where $Z = 1$ if $X_{12} \ge 21$ and is 0 otherwise.  We then add the constraint $X_{ij} \ge 0$ for all $(i,j) \in A$.  Next we add the term $+100 Z$ to the objective function.  Finally, we add the following constraints:  $100Z \ge X_{12} - 20$, and $X_{13} \ge 30Z$.}

\ques{20}
As a newly commissioned 2nd Lt you have been tasked with connecting 6 forward operating bases (located at nodes 1 through 6) at minimal cost.  Connecting a base to another base has a cost, and each base must have a ``path'' of wiring to every other base. However, not every base can be wired directly to every other base.  Your boss, Capt May B. Wright has
determined that the locations and possible connections form the following network, with costs
($c_{ij}$ in thousands of dollars) listed next to the arcs (you may assume he is correct in his drawing). He has denoted the network $\cG = (\cV, \cE)$:

\begin{center}
        \begin{tikzpicture}
          [font=\scriptsize,
          node/.style={shape=circle,draw=black,fill=white!20, text=black,minimum width=0.5cm,thick},
          arc/.style={->,>=stealth,thick},
          edge/.style={thick}]

            \node (4) [node] at (6,2) {4};
            \node (5) [node] at (6,-2) {5};

          \draw [edge] (1) to node [auto] {3} (2);
          \draw [edge] (1) to node [auto] {9} (3);
          \draw [edge] (2) to node [left] {12} (3);
          \draw [edge] (2) to node [auto] {10} (4);

          \draw [edge] (2) to node [label={[shift={(-0.75,1.0)}]15}] {} (5);

Thus, you are trying to determine a minimum spanning tree on
the given network. We denote the edge between two nodes $i$ and $j$ by the pair $(i,j)$ with $i<j$ and define the binary variables $X_{ij}$ to be one when the edge $(i,j)$ is in the minimum spanning tree and zero otherwise. Capt Wright started formulating the integer program below, labeled \eqref{eq:mst}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mst}
  \tag{MST}
  \begin{array}{llll}
    \min & \Sum_{(i,j) \in \cE} c_{ij} X_{ij} & & \\
    \mbox{s.t.} & \Sum_{\{j | (i,j) \in \cE\}} X_{ij} + 
    \Sum_{\{j |(j,i) \in \cE\}} X_{ji} \geq {?}, & \forall i \in \cV &
    \mbox{(a)} \\[4mm]
    & \Sum_{(i,j) \in \cE} X_{ij} = |\cV| - 1 & & \mbox{(b)} \\[4mm]
    %& \Sum_{(i,j) \in \cE | i,j \in U} X_{ij} \leq |U| - 1 & \forall U
    %\subset \cV, 3 \leq |U| \leq |V| - 1 & \mbox{(b)} \\[4mm]
    & X_{ij} \in \{0,1\} & \forall (i,j) \in \cE. &

%\bques{10}
%Recall that an undirected graph, $\cG = (\cV,\cE)$, is a tree if $\cG$ is connected (there is a path between every pair of nodes), and has no cycles. A leaf is a node in a tree with exactly one arc adjacent to it. Prove that any tree has at least two leaves, assuming that the number of nodes, $n$, is greater than or equal to two. 

% Start a path at an arbitrary node, walking to any neighbor that hasn't been visited before.  After at most $n$ steps, we must reach a node $v$ where there are no untraversed neighbors.  Therefore, $v$ must have only one neighbor and is a leaf, otherwise there is a cycle and the graph is not a tree.  We can then traverse a path starting at $v$, and the node where the path stops must be a second leaf.
