We assume that the linear program under consideration is
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
  \max & c^\top x \\
  \mbox{s.t.} & A x = b \\
  & x \geq 0,
\end{array}
\]
where $A \in \R^{m \times n}$ is full row rank and that $b \in \R^m$
and $c \in \R^n$. We also assume the column vectors of $A$ are $A_i$
for $i = 1,\ldots,n$.

\noindent
\textbf{8.23} ({\it Hint: consider the basis matrix associated with a
    solution with both $x^+$ and $x^-$.}): Following the hint, we can
  see that the basic matrix is singular. Suppose the original column
  for $x$ was the vector $A_x$. Then, after the substitution there will
  be the columns $A_x$ for $x^+$ and $-A_x$ for $x^-$. But because
  $A_x + (-A_x) = 0$, if $x^+$ and $x^-$
  were basic, then the basis would be associated with linearly
  dependent columns of the constraint matrix, a contradiction.

  \medskip

  \paragraph{Discussion:} This problem highlights the importance of
  the definition of the basic solution and Lemma 7.1. In particular,
  the argument requires that the columns are linearly independent.

%\item 8.24: As stated, the problem allows for the following
%  assumptions.
%  Suppose in a given simplex iteration, the current basic
%  feasible solution is $x$. Also, suppose that for a
%  nonbasic variable $x_k$, the simplex direction $d^k$ is improving so
%  that $c^\top d^k > 0$. Finally, suppose that the stepsize is
%  calculated according to the min. ratio test so that $x_j$ is the
%  leaving variable, which implies $d^k_j < 0$. After the pivot, let the new basis
%  be denoted by $\cB$. 
%
%  Consider the new basic solution after pivoting in $x_k$ and pivoting
%  out $x_j$. As $x_j$ is now nonbasic, we can construct an associated
%  simplex direction, $d^j$, which will have:
%  \[
%  d^j_j = 1, \quad d^j_i = 0 \mbox{ for all nonbasic components $i\not=j$.}  
%  \]
%  Then, consider the vector $d^k + (-d^k_j) d^j$. The $j$th component
%  is zero. Moreover, if $d^k + (-d^k_j) d^j \not= 0$, then because $A d^k =
%  A d^j = 0$, 
%  \[
%  0 = A d^k + (-d^k_j) A d^j = \sum_i A_i (d^k-d^k_j d^j)_i =
%  \sum_{i \in \cB} A_i (d^k_i - d^k_j d^j_i),
%  \]
%  a contradiction, as the vectors $\{A_i | i \in \cB\}$ are linearly
%  independent. Now, if $d^k + (-d^k_j) d^j = 0$, then 
%  \[
%  c^\top d^k = d^k_j (c^\top d^j) > 0,
%  \]
%which implies $c^\top d^j < 0$ since $d^k_j < 0$. Thus, entering $x_j$ would not be associated with an
%  {\bf improving} simplex direction.
%
%  \medskip
%
%  \paragraph{Discussion:} Note that the definition of the basic
%  solution and Lemma 7.1 is again necessary for this argument, as it relies
%  on the linear independence of the columns of $A$ associated with the
%  basic solution, $x^k$. The argument also requires a knowledge of how
%  the simplex directions are constructed.
%
%
%\item 8.27: We must show that $x + \lambda_{\max} d^k$ is a basic
%  feasible solution and can assume $\lambda_{\max} > 0$ and exists, as
%  $x$ is nondegenerate and $d^k$ is not an unbounded improving
%  direction. Using Lemma 7.1, we must show: (a) $A(x + \lambda_{\max}
%  d^k) = b$, $x + \lambda_{\max} d^k \geq 0$; (b) at least $n-m$
%  components of $x + \lambda_{\max} d^k$ are zero; and (c) there is a basis
%  associated with $x + \lambda_{\max} d^k$ which corresponds to $m$
%  linearly independent columns of $A$.
%
%  To see (a), note that the definition of $d^k$ indicates that $A d^k
%  = 0$. Thus, for all $\lambda \in \R$, 
%  \[
%  A (x + \lambda d^k) = A x + \lambda Ad^k = b + 0 = b.
%  \]
%  Also, as $\lambda_{\max} = \min\{ -x_i/d_i | d_i < 0, x_i \mbox{ basic}\}$, for any component $i \in
%  \{1,\ldots,n\}$,
%  \[
%  x_i + \lambda_{\max} d^k_i \geq x_i - (x_i/d_i) d_i = 0.
%  \]
%  Note that the inequality holds if $d_i > 0$ as $\lambda > 0$ (this
%  is the case when $i = k$. Also, if $x_i$ is nonbasic but $i \not=
%  k$, then $x_i = d_i = 0$. Therefore, (a) is true.
%
%  To see (b), note that $d^k_i = 0$ for all nonbasic components except
%  one, namely $d^k_k = 1$. Also, there is a basic component $i$ such
%  that $-x_i/d^k_i = \lambda_{\max}$, so $x_i + \lambda_{\max} d^k_i =
%  0$. Thus, the number of nonzero components of $x + \lambda_{\max} d^k$
%  is at most the same as $x$. Thus, the number of zero components is
%  at least as many as $x$, namely, at least $n-m$ as $x$ is a basic
%  feasible solution. Thus, (b) is true.
%
%  To see (c), let $\cB$ be the basis associated with $x$ and $\cBhat$
%  the basis associated with $x + \lambda_{\max} d^k$. Note that $k \in
%  \cBhat$ by the definition of $d^k$. Also, let the indice of the
%  leaving variable be $j$, so that $x_j > 0$ but $x_j + \lambda_{\max}
%  d^k_j = 0$ and $j \in \cB$ but $j \not\in \cBhat$. For a
%  contradiction, suppose that the column vectors, $\{A_i | i \in \cBhat\}$ were linearly dependent. Then, there is a
%  nonzero vector $v$ such that $v_i = 0$ for all $i \not\in \cBhat$ and
%  \[
%  A v = \sum_{i \in \cBhat} A_i v_i = 0.
%  \]
%  If $v_k = 0$ then $\sum_{i \in \cB} A_i v_i = 0$, a
%  contradiction. But then, because $d^k_j < 0$ and $v_j = 0$, 
%  we have $d^k - v \not= 0$ and so
%  \[
%  0 = A v + A(-v_k) d^k = \sum_{i \in \cB} A_i (v_i - v_k d_i),
%  \]
%  implying that the vectors $\{A_i | i \in \cB\}$ are linearly
%  dependent, a contradiction.
%
%  \medskip
%
%  \paragraph{Discussion:} The problem emphasizes the importance of
%    linear dependence and independence in the definition of basic
%    solution, as well as the role the min. ratio test plays in
%    maintaining nonnegativity.
